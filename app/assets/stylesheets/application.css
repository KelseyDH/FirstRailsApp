/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the top of the
 * compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.
 *
 *### NOTE ABOUT REQUIRE:  you can "require_directory ./abc" THEN require special CSS after
 *### OR:  YOU CAN USE e.g. "stub home" to exclude a css page from a require_tree;
 *= require_self
 *= jquery.ui.all
 *= require_tree
